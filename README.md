# laravelInstall
To install:

curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MattKaizer/laravelInstall/master/runLaravel.sh | bash

or

wget -qo- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MattKaizer/laravelInstall/master/runLaravel.sh | bash

I have to say that i made just for me, to speed up somethings and because i use mac, maybe you will have to modify it to use it, specially the editors.
